When you‚Äôre sick or symptomatic, your immune system is already weakened, and getting blood drawn can weaken it even more. This is the reason why many people get sicker in the weeks and months after getting a lot of blood drawn. This can create a viscous cycle that leads to people becoming sicker than ever before. \n\nGetting blood work can be important at times and you should always work with your doctor on what is best for you. But there are steps and tools you can put in place to protect your immune system before, during, and after getting blood drawn.

Refreshing and delicious, this slushy makes a wonderful light breakfast or snack. If you suffer with constipation, you might find the combination of grapes and aloe vera in this drink brings you welcome relief!\n\nGrapes contain high amounts of powerful antioxidants known as bioflavonoids, resveratrol, and anthocyanins. These phytochemicals are anti-inflammatory, anti-viral, anti-microbial, anti-aging, and anti-cancerous and provide protection against anemia, degenerative nerve diseases, heart disease, viral and fungal infections, Alzheimer‚Äôs, and autoimmune disorders. Grapes can also help provide relief from asthma, migraines, constipation, gastritis, chronic acidosis, indigestion, kidney disorders, fatigue, and vision problems.\n\nFresh aloe leaf gel binds onto toxic debris in the intestinal tract and carries it out of the colon during elimination. Aloe also reduces poisons and toxins in the intestinal tract so that they don‚Äôt travel up to the liver. It expels and diminishes ammonia inside the intestinal tract that otherwise seeps into the liver when food is putrefying due to low hydrochloric acid and bile production.\n\nAloe also works wonders for assimilation, circulation, and elimination. It is known to purify the blood, reduce inflammation, ease arthritis pain, prevent kidney stones, lower high cholesterol, prevent Candida, boost physical endurance, benefit cardiovascular health, and protect the body from oxidative stress. Aloe soothes ulcers, hemorrhoids, gastritis, diverticulitis, colitis, irritable bowel syndrome, and other digestive disorders. Aloe provides recovery from fatigue and aids in muscle function as well as optimal utilization of several vitamins, minerals, and enzymes. Its alkaline nature helps to soothe acidosis and alkalinize the whole body.\n\nAloe Grape Slushy\n\nIngredients:\n\n2‚Äù-4‚Äù fresh aloe leaf gel\n2 cups frozen seedless black or purple grapes\nsplash of water, if needed to blend\n\nDirections:\n\nPlace all the ingredients in a blender and blend until smooth.

Many people struggle with gastrointestinal pain that radiates all through the abdomen and torso without realizing that it originates from the stomach or intestinal tract. Aloe vera has chemical compounds that neutralize acid and calm nerves in the intestinal tract linings, slowing down and stopping intestinal spasms. Aloe neutralizes acids and inhibits bacterial and viral growth as well as yeast, unproductive fungus, and mold growth. Aloe vera also soothes the linings of the intestinal tract, calming inflamed intestinal tract nerves, inhibiting gastric nerve spasms, and alleviating pressure on the vagus nerves.\n\nSuggested Applications for Medical Medium Aloe Vera Shock Therapy:\n\nStomach pain, gastrointestinal pain, intestinal and stomach pain that rises into the chest or runs through the back and up to the neck and shoulders, colitis, IBS, Crohn‚Äôs, celiac, acid reflux, ulcers, stomach burning, H. pylori, SIBO, stomach pain shortly after eating a meal, stomach and intestinal cramping, gastritis, severe bloating that‚Äôs painful, constipation, acid attacks, gastroparesis.\n\nMedical Medium Aloe Vera Shock Therapy Directions:\n\nFor an adult, consume 2 to 4 inches of fresh aloe vera gel (skin removed) every two to four waking hours.\n\nContinue this therapy for one to seven days.\n\nAfter three or more days off Aloe Vera Shock Therapy, you‚Äôre welcome to cycle through one to seven days of the therapy again. In between rounds of Aloe Vera Shock Therapy, you can do 2 or more inches of fresh aloe vera gel daily or twice a day.\n\nTo prepare the aloe gel, carefully slice open your 2- to 4-inch piece of aloe vera leaf, filleting it as if it were a fish and trimming away the green skin and spikes. Scoop out the clear gel.\n\nMake sure you do not use the skin. As you‚Äôre scooping out the aloe gel, try not to scrape the skin. The chemical compound in the green skin can be irritating for some people.\n\nCONTINUED BELOW\n\nComment ALOE THERAPY to get link now",

    "caption": "Difficulty Coping \n \nPeople should never be blamed for a struggle to cope. What‚Äôs really happening is a sensitive central nervous system and neurotransmitters that are weakened. The person is not weak. You could be the strongest person with the strongest will, spirit, personality, and nature‚Äîand when neurotransmitters are affected in some way, it makes it tough to deal with some of life‚Äôs challenges. Neurotransmitter disorders are common for anybody dealing with ME/CFS or any kind of autoimmune condition. Toxic heavy metal loads and viral loads combined create a lot of neurotoxins, which weaken neurotransmitters. When this is coupled with adrenal issues and other symptoms, it can be difficult to cope with any additional stressor that comes your way. \n \nNot that you need to be diagnosed with a condition to have trouble coping. Toxic heavy metals in the areas of the brain that help us process emotional information and maintain equilibrium when navigating challenges can make difficult times in life even more difficult. Heavy metals dampen and hamper neurotransmitter activity. That could cause someone to retreat or procrastinate during a time of emotional stress, which can lead to not feeling able to look at a document they‚Äôre supposed to look at, contact someone they‚Äôre supposed to contact, or generally ‚Äúdeal.‚Äù \n \nThere are also cases where someone can be very accomplished, with incredible grit, in one area of life and yet have an emotional sore spot or a soul injury with a PTSD pocket. Consider a super athlete with a strong personality, for example, who wakes up early every morning to run 20 miles, and yet you bring up a particular subject, and they can‚Äôt cope. Once again, that‚Äôs from heavy metals in certain areas of the brain creating little blocks. That will happen especially if someone has an emotional wound around the subject.

These metals are also fuel for viruses, and it‚Äôs these viruses that are the unknown cause of so many chronic mystery illnesses today.\n\nLead, mercury, copper, cadmium, nickel, arsenic, and aluminum can all build up in the body to create or contribute to illness. When was the last time you used aluminum foil? Or perhaps you live in a house with copper pipes. Or you regularly walk through a park treated with pesticides (which often contain toxic heavy metals). Potential exposure is everywhere, and sometimes unavoidable. It‚Äôs even falling out of the sky in vapors. In some cases, the heavy metals in our cells have nothing to do with exposure in our lifetime. Mercury, the most corrupting of the toxic heavy metals, can easily stick around in a bloodline for millennia, passed from generation to generation, amplifying as it goes. So the mercury in a child‚Äôs cerebral midline canal that‚Äôs causing his autistic symptoms could have been mined 3,000 years ago‚Äîand could be causing more trouble now than ever before.\n\nOn their own, these heavy metals are poisons. But they also tend to oxidize, causing even more problems, such as toxic runoff that damages any tissue in its path. Toxic heavy metals aren‚Äôt just a problem in the brain. When they‚Äôre present anywhere in the body, they lower overall immunity and act as fuel for viruses and bacteria.‚Äù - Excerpt from Life-Changing Foods\n\nTo safely and effectively remove metals from your body, focus on eating the below five foods that work synergistically together every day.\n\nWild blueberries\nFresh Cilantro\nSpirulina\nBarley grass juice powder\nAtlantic dulse\n\nComment HEAVY METAL DETOX and we will send you link to smoothie recipe now",

These little purple gems offer an explosion of delicious flavor, and their healing properties for the liver and the rest of the body are a true miracle.\n\nWild blueberries contain dozens of undiscovered antioxidants, including anthocyanin varieties. There‚Äôs not just one pigment inside a wild blueberry; there are dozens of pigments not yet researched or studied. The wild blueberry is to the liver as mother‚Äôs milk is to a baby. Not only do wild blueberries have the ability to grab on to plenty of troublemakers, but they also hold on to them as they leave the liver, in a way that most other healing foods cannot. The pigments in wild blueberries have the ability to saturate deep into liver cells and cross cell walls and membranes inside the liver, spreading their blue everywhere. Wild blueberries enhance the intestinal tract, feeding good bacteria there, which benefits the liver greatly.\n\nWild Blueberry Porridge\n\nIngredients:\n\n1 cup millet or gluten-free oat flour\n2 cups water; more if needed\n¬Ω tsp cinnamon \n¬Ω cup wild blueberries\n2 tbsps fresh wild or cultivated blueberries, or frozen wild blueberries, for garnish\nPure maple syrup or raw honey, to taste\nDirections:\n\nPlace the millet, water, and cinnamon in a small saucepan, stir, and bring it to a boil. Add more water if needed. Reduce to a simmer, cover, and cook until soft, about 10 to 15 minutes, stirring intermittently. Once it‚Äôs cooked, remove the saucepan from the heat, cover it, and let it sit for a few minutes. \n\nAlternatively, place the oats, water, and cinnamon in a small saucepan and bring to a simmer. Add more water if needed. Cover and cook until soft, about 5 to 10 minutes. \n\nStir in the wild blueberries and maple syrup to taste. Serve topped with the 2 tablespoons of blueberries.\n\nComment RECIPE and we will send it to you now",

    "caption": "Insomnia\n\nTrouble sleeping can sometimes be as simple as a racing mind that‚Äôs trying to solve a problem, stress, or worry in your life. We don‚Äôt need to stress ourselves out over a bad night or two. When sleeping problems become chronic, that‚Äôs when there‚Äôs more going on. Neurotransmitter chemicals are one critical part of being able to sleep. Electricity is running through every neuron as we‚Äôre sleeping. If neurotransmitters are diminished, electrical impulses have a tough time traveling throughout the brain. Low neurotransmitter chemicals or weakened ones can cause the brain to have difficulty finding balance so you can ease into sleep and stay there.\n\nSomeone may also have a sensitive nervous system due to a chronic, low-grade infection in the liver of a virus such as EBV or shingles, which often goes undiagnosed. Neurotoxins breaking out of the liver and traveling through the bloodstream can reach the brain, where they saturate, pollute, and diminish neurotransmitter chemicals. This is especially true if someone‚Äôs diet is not conducive to protecting them from viruses and building up neurotransmitter activity.\n\nOften people with toxic heavy metals inside the brain have difficulty sleeping from toxic heavy metals oxidizing and affecting neurotransmitter chemicals. In cases of very chronic, serious insomnia, it‚Äôs usually a combination of both toxic heavy metals in the brain and a low-grade viral infection in the body. Toxic heavy metals and viruses weaken the central nervous system just enough to constantly disturb someone‚Äôs sleep or to make it very difficult to fall asleep in the first place.\n\nBody aches and pains from low-grade viral infection or injury can also create insomnia. So can pharmaceuticals that make a liver sluggish and stagnant while feeding a low-grade infection of a virus such as EBV.\n\nComment INSOMNIA for a link to specific healing support, including a supplement protocol with dosages in Brain Saver and Brain Saver Protocols, Cleanses & Recipes",

Try them over a salad, with steamed vegetables, topped with salsa, in a lettuce or cabbage leaf, dipped into the natural ketchup recipe in Cleanse to Heal, or any other way you can dream up.\n\nZucchini: Soothing to the intestinal tract walls, pushing out pathogens such as bacteria and fungus, allowing for better absorption of nutrients that can be sent up to the liver. Zucchini is a beneficial gallbladder food, containing phytochemicals that actually reduce gallbladder inflammation.\n\nPotatoes: Abundant in amino acids that specifically inhibit viral growth. Potatoes are high in glucose that provides substance to the liver, as it‚Äôs precisely what the liver relies on to keep strong. Potatoes keep the liver grounded and stable, giving us a good constitution.\n\nCarrot, Zucchini and Potato Patties\n\nIngredients:\n\n2 potatoes\n2 carrots\n1 zucchini\n1 teaspoon garlic powder\n1 teaspoon onion powder\n1 teaspoon dried oregano\n1 teaspoon paprika\n\nDirections:\n\nAdd 3 inches of water to a medium-sized pot, bring it to a boil, and add a steaming basket. Place the potatoes and carrots in the basket, cover, and steam for 15 to 20 minutes, until tender. Remove from heat and cool completely.\n\nPreheat oven to 350¬∞F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.\n\nGrate the zucchini and place it in a muslin cloth or nut milk bag to squeeze out all the water. Make sure that the zucchini is very dry; otherwise it will take the patties longer to crisp up in the oven. Add it to a mixing bowl. Grate the potatoes and carrots and place them in the bowl with the grated zucchini. Add the garlic powder, onion powder, dried oregano, and paprika and mix until combined.\n\nForm the mixture into about 8 patties and place them on the baking sheet. Place in the oven and cook for 45 to 60 minutes, until browned and crispy, flipping them halfway through. Allow the patties to cool for 10 to 15 minutes before eating so they firm up.\n\nComment RECIPE for a link to be sent to you now",
