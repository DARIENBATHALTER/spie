Many people struggle with gastrointestinal pain that radiates all through the abdomen and torso without realizing that it originates from the stomach or intestinal tract. Aloe vera has chemical compounds that neutralize acid and calm nerves in the intestinal tract linings, slowing down and stopping intestinal spasms. Aloe neutralizes acids and inhibits bacterial and viral growth as well as yeast, unproductive fungus, and mold growth. Aloe vera also soothes the linings of the intestinal tract, calming inflamed intestinal tract nerves, inhibiting gastric nerve spasms, and alleviating pressure on the vagus nerves.\n\nSuggested Applications for Medical Medium Aloe Vera Shock Therapy:\n\nStomach pain, gastrointestinal pain, intestinal and stomach pain that rises into the chest or runs through the back and up to the neck and shoulders, colitis, IBS, Crohn’s, celiac, acid reflux, ulcers, stomach burning, H. pylori, SIBO, stomach pain shortly after eating a meal, stomach and intestinal cramping, gastritis, severe bloating that’s painful, constipation, acid attacks, gastroparesis.\n\nMedical Medium Aloe Vera Shock Therapy Directions:\n\nFor an adult, consume 2 to 4 inches of fresh aloe vera gel (skin removed) every two to four waking hours.\n\nContinue this therapy for one to seven days.\n\nAfter three or more days off Aloe Vera Shock Therapy, you’re welcome to cycle through one to seven days of the therapy again. In between rounds of Aloe Vera Shock Therapy, you can do 2 or more inches of fresh aloe vera gel daily or twice a day.\n\nTo prepare the aloe gel, carefully slice open your 2- to 4-inch piece of aloe vera leaf, filleting it as if it were a fish and trimming away the green skin and spikes. Scoop out the clear gel.\n\nMake sure you do not use the skin. As you’re scooping out the aloe gel, try not to scrape the skin.

We don’t need to stress ourselves out over a bad night or two. When sleeping problems become chronic, that’s when there’s more going on. Neurotransmitter chemicals are one critical part of being able to sleep. Electricity is running through every neuron as we’re sleeping. If neurotransmitters are diminished, electrical impulses have a tough time traveling throughout the brain. Low neurotransmitter chemicals or weakened ones can cause the brain to have difficulty finding balance so you can ease into sleep and stay there.\n\nSomeone may also have a sensitive nervous system due to a chronic, low-grade infection in the liver of a virus such as EBV or shingles, which often goes undiagnosed. Neurotoxins breaking out of the liver and traveling through the bloodstream can reach the brain, where they saturate, pollute, and diminish neurotransmitter chemicals. This is especially true if someone’s diet is not conducive to protecting them from viruses and building up neurotransmitter activity.\n\nOften people with toxic heavy metals inside the brain have difficulty sleeping from toxic heavy metals oxidizing and affecting neurotransmitter chemicals. In cases of very chronic, serious insomnia, it’s usually a combination of both toxic heavy metals in the brain and a low-grade viral infection in the body.

The person is not weak. You could be the strongest person with the strongest will, spirit, personality, and nature—and when neurotransmitters are affected in some way, it makes it tough to deal with some of life’s challenges. Neurotransmitter disorders are common for anybody dealing with ME/CFS or any kind of autoimmune condition.

When this is coupled with adrenal issues and other symptoms, it can be difficult to cope with any additional stressor that comes your way. \n \nNot that you need to be diagnosed with a condition to have trouble coping. Toxic heavy metals in the areas of the brain that help us process emotional information and maintain equilibrium when navigating challenges can make difficult times in life even more difficult. Heavy metals dampen and hamper neurotransmitter activity.

    "description": "Wild Blueberry Porridge {Gluten-Free, Dairy-Free, & Fat-Free} A Cleanse To Heal Recipe\n\nComment RECIPE and we will send it to you now\n\nThis recipe uses millet or gluten-free oatmeal with the addition of a secret weapon: wild blueberries. These little purple gems offer an explosion of delicious flavor, and their healing properties for the liver and the rest of the body are a true miracle.\n\nWild blueberries contain dozens of undiscovered antioxidants, including anthocyanin varieties. There’s not just one pigment inside a wild blueberry; there are dozens of pigments not yet researched or studied. The wild blueberry is to the liver as mother’s milk is to a baby. Not only do wild blueberries have the ability to grab on to plenty of troublemakers, but they also hold on to them as they leave the liver, in a way that most other healing foods cannot. The pigments in wild blueberries have the ability to saturate deep into liver cells and cross cell walls and membranes inside the liver, spreading their blue everywhere. Wild blueberries enhance the intestinal tract, feeding good bacteria there, which benefits the liver greatly.\n\nWild Blueberry Porridge\n\nIngredients:\n\n1 cup millet or gluten-free oat flour\n2 cups water; more if needed\n½ tsp cinnamon \n½ cup wild blueberries\n2 tbsps fresh wild or cultivated blueberries, or frozen wild blueberries, for garnish\nPure maple syrup or raw honey, to taste\nDirections:\n\nPlace the millet, water, and cinnamon in a small saucepan, stir, and bring it to a boil. Add more water if needed. Reduce to a simmer, cover, and cook until soft, about 10 to 15 minutes, stirring intermittently. Once it’s cooked, remove the saucepan from the heat, cover it, and let it sit for a few minutes. \n\nAlternatively, place the oats, water, and cinnamon in a small saucepan and bring to a simmer.

    "caption": "Wild Blueberry Porridge {Gluten-Free, Dairy-Free, & Fat-Free} A Cleanse To Heal Recipe\n\nComment RECIPE and we will send it to you now\n\nThis recipe uses millet or gluten-free oatmeal with the addition of a secret weapon: wild blueberries. These little purple gems offer an explosion of delicious flavor, and their healing properties for the liver and the rest of the body are a true miracle.\n\nWild blueberries contain dozens of undiscovered antioxidants, including anthocyanin varieties. There’s not just one pigment inside a wild blueberry; there are dozens of pigments not yet researched or studied. The wild blueberry is to the liver as mother’s milk is to a baby. Not only do wild blueberries have the ability to grab on to plenty of troublemakers, but they also hold on to them as they leave the liver, in a way that most other healing foods cannot. The pigments in wild blueberries have the ability to saturate deep into liver cells and cross cell walls and membranes inside the liver, spreading their blue everywhere. Wild blueberries enhance the intestinal tract, feeding good bacteria there, which benefits the liver greatly.\n\nWild Blueberry Porridge\n\nIngredients:\n\n1 cup millet or gluten-free oat flour\n2 cups water; more if needed\n½ tsp cinnamon \n½ cup wild blueberries\n2 tbsps fresh wild or cultivated blueberries, or frozen wild blueberries, for garnish\nPure maple syrup or raw honey, to taste\nDirections:\n\nPlace the millet, water, and cinnamon in a small saucepan, stir, and bring it to a boil. Add more water if needed. Reduce to a simmer, cover, and cook until soft, about 10 to 15 minutes, stirring intermittently. Once it’s cooked, remove the saucepan from the heat, cover it, and let it sit for a few minutes. \n\nAlternatively, place the oats, water, and cinnamon in a small saucepan and bring to a simmer. Add more water if needed. Cover and cook until soft, about 5 to 10 minutes. \n\nStir in the wild blueberries and maple syrup to taste. Serve topped with the 2 tablespoons of blueberries.\n\nComment RECIPE and we will send it to you now",

    "description": "Aloe Grape Slushy\n\nComment ALOE for link to recipe\n\nGet the incredible healing benefits of aloe vera in this sweet grape slushy. Refreshing and delicious, this slushy makes a wonderful light breakfast or snack. If you suffer with constipation, you might find the combination of grapes and aloe vera in this drink brings you welcome relief!\n\nGrapes contain high amounts of powerful antioxidants known as bioflavonoids, resveratrol, and anthocyanins. These phytochemicals are anti-inflammatory, anti-viral, anti-microbial, anti-aging, and anti-cancerous and provide protection against anemia, degenerative nerve diseases, heart disease, viral and fungal infections, Alzheimer’s, and autoimmune disorders. Grapes can also help provide relief from asthma, migraines, constipation, gastritis, chronic acidosis, indigestion, kidney disorders, fatigue, and vision problems.\n\nFresh aloe leaf gel binds onto toxic debris in the intestinal tract and carries it out of the colon during elimination. Aloe also reduces poisons and toxins in the intestinal tract so that they don’t travel up to the liver. It expels and diminishes ammonia inside the intestinal tract that otherwise seeps into the liver when food is putrefying due to low hydrochloric acid and bile production.\n\nAloe also works wonders for assimilation, circulation, and elimination. It is known to purify the blood, reduce inflammation, ease arthritis pain, prevent kidney stones, lower high cholesterol, prevent Candida, boost physical endurance, benefit cardiovascular health, and protect the body from oxidative stress. Aloe soothes ulcers, hemorrhoids, gastritis, diverticulitis, colitis, irritable bowel syndrome, and other digestive disorders. Aloe provides recovery from fatigue and aids in muscle function as well as optimal utilization of several vitamins, minerals, and enzymes. Its alkaline nature helps to soothe acidosis and alkalinize the whole body.\n\nAloe Grape Slushy\n\nIngredients:\n\n2”-4” fresh aloe leaf gel\n2 cups frozen seedless black or purple grapes\nsplash of water, if needed to blend\n\nDirections:\n\nPlace all the ingredients in a blender and blend until smooth.

    "description": "Your Healing Is Holy: You’re Seen From Above\n\nComment HEAL to be DM’d a link to this latest, eye-opening podcast episode.\n\nIf you are struggling with chronic illness, always remember that your body is working hard for you every day, fighting for you to heal, and that your body has your back and loves you unconditionally. Always know that you are a good person. Pat yourself on the back and always have compassion for yourself. Do not judge yourself because you became ill. You did not create your illness and you do not deserve to be chronically ill. \n\nIt’s hard to have clarity when a person can’t find the answers they need to complete deep healing. It’s hard to keep clarity when others do not know their suffering and struggles and it’s sometimes hard to see straight when someone is in pain, fighting for their lives on an hourly basis, but always remember: you can heal and healing is what your body understands. Every little powerful tool you apply to your health rings through your body and sounds off your healing powers. Your body holds these healing powers and they are always there, ready to be ignited. \n\nAs you go to bed at night, remember there is an audience and you are not truly alone. Call upon the angels and ask them to be by your bedside—they are watching you and when you wake up in the morning, know that God is there watching over you and knows about your struggles. He sees you throughout the night and knows you are working hard every day on your healing. God knows what a good soul you are and what kind of soul you are. Chronic illness does not govern over every aspect of who you are but instead becomes a profound spiritual growth experience that can only come from the struggles of once being sick. Just around the corner comes the day you will look back at it all while being healthy again—you will see it from a distance and have a knowing wisdom to carry throughout this lifetime.\n\nComment HEAL to be DM’d a link to this latest, eye-opening podcast episode.",
