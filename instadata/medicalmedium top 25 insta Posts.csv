Aloe Vera Shock Therapy

Do you suffer from stomach pain, acid reflux, ulcers, H. Pylori, Crohn’s, Colitis, IBS, bloating, intestinal cramping, gastritis, SIBO, constipation, diverticulitis or diverticulosis? If you have one or more of these conditions or have stomach issues in general, then you should know about Medical Medium Aloe Vera Shock Therapy and ask your doctor what they think about this food.

People with mystery stomach and intestinal tract problems have found powerful results and even in some situations avoided surgeries because of the healing power of Aloe Vera Shock Therapy. The goal with using aloe is to slow down and eventually stop intestinal tract spasms, bring inflammation down, coat the gut linings, neutralize acids and inhibit bacterial and viral growth as well as yeast, unproductive fungus and mold growth.

To do the Medical Medium Aloe Vera Shock Therapy, for an adult, consume two to four inches of fresh aloe vera gel, skin removed, every two to four waking hours for up to seven days consecutively.

Did you know that getting blood drawn removes some of your immune system? This is original Medical Medium information. When you’re sick or symptomatic, your immune system is already weakened, and getting blood drawn can weaken it even more. This is the reason why many people get sicker in the weeks and months after getting a lot of blood drawn. This can create a viscous cycle that leads to people becoming sicker than ever before. 

Getting blood work can be important at times and you should always work with your doctor on what is best for you. But there are steps and tools you can put in place to protect your immune system before, during, and after getting blood drawn.

Comment HEAVY METAL DETOX and we will send you link to smoothie recipe now

Toxic heavy metals are behind some of the most widespread health issues today: ADHD, autism, Alzheimer’s, infertility, Crohn’s, ulcerative colitis, depression, anxiety, cancers, seizures, and more. These metals are also fuel for viruses, and it’s these viruses that are the unknown cause of so many chronic mystery illnesses today.

Lead, mercury, copper, cadmium, nickel, arsenic, and aluminum can all build up in the body to create or contribute to illness. When was the last time you used aluminum foil? Or perhaps you live in a house with copper pipes. Or you regularly walk through a park treated with pesticides (which often contain toxic heavy metals). Potential exposure is everywhere, and sometimes unavoidable. It’s even falling out of the sky in vapors. In some cases, the heavy metals in our cells have nothing to do with exposure in our lifetime. Mercury, the most corrupting of the toxic heavy metals, can easily stick around in a bloodline for millennia, passed from generation to generation, amplifying as it goes. So the mercury in a child’s cerebral midline canal that’s causing his autistic symptoms could have been mined 3,000 years ago—and could be causing more trouble now than ever before.

On their own, these heavy metals are poisons. But they also tend to oxidize, causing even more problems, such as toxic runoff that damages any tissue in its path. Toxic heavy metals aren’t just a problem in the brain. When they’re present anywhere in the body, they lower overall immunity and act as fuel for viruses and bacteria.” - Excerpt from Life-Changing Foods

To safely and effectively remove metals from your body, focus on eating the below five foods that work synergistically together every day.

Wild blueberries
Fresh Cilantro
Spirulina
Barley grass juice powder

Comment ALOE THERAPY to get link now

Medical Medium Aloe Vera Shock Therapy is an original Medical Medium healing tool from Brain Saver Protocols, Cleanses & Recipes. Many people struggle with gastrointestinal pain that radiates all through the abdomen and torso without realizing that it originates from the stomach or intestinal tract. Aloe vera has chemical compounds that neutralize acid and calm nerves in the intestinal tract linings, slowing down and stopping intestinal spasms. Aloe neutralizes acids and inhibits bacterial and viral growth as well as yeast, unproductive fungus, and mold growth. Aloe vera also soothes the linings of the intestinal tract, calming inflamed intestinal tract nerves, inhibiting gastric nerve spasms, and alleviating pressure on the vagus nerves.

Suggested Applications for Medical Medium Aloe Vera Shock Therapy:

Stomach pain, gastrointestinal pain, intestinal and stomach pain that rises into the chest or runs through the back and up to the neck and shoulders, colitis, IBS, Crohn’s, celiac, acid reflux, ulcers, stomach burning, H. pylori, SIBO, stomach pain shortly after eating a meal, stomach and intestinal cramping, gastritis, severe bloating that’s painful, constipation, acid attacks, gastroparesis.

Medical Medium Aloe Vera Shock Therapy Directions:

For an adult, consume 2 to 4 inches of fresh aloe vera gel (skin removed) every two to four waking hours.

Continue this therapy for one to seven days.

After three or more days off Aloe Vera Shock Therapy, you’re welcome to cycle through one to seven days of the therapy again. In between rounds of Aloe Vera Shock Therapy, you can do 2 or more inches of fresh aloe vera gel daily or twice a day.

To prepare the aloe gel, carefully slice open your 2- to 4-inch piece of aloe vera leaf, filleting it as if it were a fish and trimming away the green skin and spikes. Scoop out the clear gel.

Make sure you do not use the skin. As you’re scooping out the aloe gel, try not to scrape the skin. The chemical compound in the green skin can be irritating for some people.

Trouble sleeping can sometimes be as simple as a racing mind that’s trying to solve a problem, stress, or worry in your life. We don’t need to stress ourselves out over a bad night or two. When sleeping problems become chronic, that’s when there’s more going on. Neurotransmitter chemicals are one critical part of being able to sleep. Electricity is running through every neuron as we’re sleeping. If neurotransmitters are diminished, electrical impulses have a tough time traveling throughout the brain. Low neurotransmitter chemicals or weakened ones can cause the brain to have difficulty finding balance so you can ease into sleep and stay there.

Someone may also have a sensitive nervous system due to a chronic, low-grade infection in the liver of a virus such as EBV or shingles, which often goes undiagnosed. Neurotoxins breaking out of the liver and traveling through the bloodstream can reach the brain, where they saturate, pollute, and diminish neurotransmitter chemicals. This is especially true if someone’s diet is not conducive to protecting them from viruses and building up neurotransmitter activity.

Often people with toxic heavy metals inside the brain have difficulty sleeping from toxic heavy metals oxidizing and affecting neurotransmitter chemicals. In cases of very chronic, serious insomnia, it’s usually a combination of both toxic heavy metals in the brain and a low-grade viral infection in the body. Toxic heavy metals and viruses weaken the central nervous system just enough to constantly disturb someone’s sleep or to make it very difficult to fall asleep in the first place.

Body aches and pains from low-grade viral infection or injury can also create insomnia. So can pharmaceuticals that make a liver sluggish and stagnant while feeding a low-grade infection of a virus such as EBV.

When life surprises us with high stress and intense moments, our brain can overheat, and we can lose precious electrolyte and glucose reserves. This tonic helps calm the mind and cool the brain down from overheating while replenishing reserves.

Cucumber juice has a fountain-of-youth effect, hydrating us at the deepest cellular level possible. Plus, cucumbers’ cooling effect makes them excellent for cooling an overheated brain. 

Celery juice provides mineral salts (namely, sodium cluster salts, a subgroup of sodium only found in celery juice) to the central nervous system.

Apples calm your system by reducing viral and bacterial loads that create inflammation, helping to reduce encephalitis (brain inflammation).

Fennel is high in vitamin C and other strong antiviral compounds that fight off pathogens.

This recipe comes from Brain Saver Protocols, Cleanses & Recipes, the companion book to Medical Medium Brain Saver. These two essential books about our most complex organ—the brain—dive deep into why people all over the world are suffering with mental health and brain-related symptoms and conditions.

Always know that you are a good person. Pat yourself on the back and always have compassion for yourself. Do not judge yourself because you became ill. You did not create your illness and you do not deserve to be chronically ill. 

It’s hard to have clarity when a person can’t find the answers they need to complete deep healing. It’s hard to keep clarity when others do not know their suffering and struggles and it’s sometimes hard to see straight when someone is in pain, fighting for their lives on an hourly basis, but always remember: you can heal and healing is what your body understands. Every little powerful tool you apply to your health rings through your body and sounds off your healing powers. Your body holds these healing powers and they are always there, ready to be ignited. 

As you go to bed at night, remember there is an audience and you are not truly alone. Call upon the angels and ask them to be by your bedside—they are watching you and when you wake up in the morning, know that God is there watching over you and knows about your struggles. He sees you throughout the night and knows you are working hard every day on your healing. God knows what a good soul you are and what kind of soul you are. Chronic illness does not govern over every aspect of who you are but instead becomes a profound spiritual growth experience that can only come from the struggles of once being sick.

People should never be blamed for a struggle to cope. What’s really happening is a sensitive central nervous system and neurotransmitters that are weakened. The person is not weak. You could be the strongest person with the strongest will, spirit, personality, and nature—and when neurotransmitters are affected in some way, it makes it tough to deal with some of life’s challenges. Neurotransmitter disorders are common for anybody dealing with ME/CFS or any kind of autoimmune condition. Toxic heavy metal loads and viral loads combined create a lot of neurotoxins, which weaken neurotransmitters. When this is coupled with adrenal issues and other symptoms, it can be difficult to cope with any additional stressor that comes your way. 
 
Not that you need to be diagnosed with a condition to have trouble coping. Toxic heavy metals in the areas of the brain that help us process emotional information and maintain equilibrium when navigating challenges can make difficult times in life even more difficult. Heavy metals dampen and hamper neurotransmitter activity. That could cause someone to retreat or procrastinate during a time of emotional stress, which can lead to not feeling able to look at a document they’re supposed to look at, contact someone they’re supposed to contact, or generally “deal.” 
 
There are also cases where someone can be very accomplished, with incredible grit, in one area of life and yet have an emotional sore spot or a soul injury with a PTSD pocket. Consider a super athlete with a strong personality, for example, who wakes up early every morning to run 20 miles, and yet you bring up a particular subject, and they can’t cope. Once again, that’s from heavy metals in certain areas of the brain creating little blocks. That will happen especially if someone has an emotional wound around the subject. Heavy metals and emotional wounds can cluster together in the brain by happenstance, making the wound or injury that much easier to trigger.

Comment RECIPE and we will send it to you now

This recipe uses millet or gluten-free oatmeal with the addition of a secret weapon: wild blueberries. These little purple gems offer an explosion of delicious flavor, and their healing properties for the liver and the rest of the body are a true miracle.

Wild blueberries contain dozens of undiscovered antioxidants, including anthocyanin varieties. There’s not just one pigment inside a wild blueberry; there are dozens of pigments not yet researched or studied. The wild blueberry is to the liver as mother’s milk is to a baby. Not only do wild blueberries have the ability to grab on to plenty of troublemakers, but they also hold on to them as they leave the liver, in a way that most other healing foods cannot. The pigments in wild blueberries have the ability to saturate deep into liver cells and cross cell walls and membranes inside the liver, spreading their blue everywhere. Wild blueberries enhance the intestinal tract, feeding good bacteria there, which benefits the liver greatly.

Wild Blueberry Porridge

Ingredients:

1 cup millet or gluten-free oat flour
2 cups water; more if needed
½ tsp cinnamon 
½ cup wild blueberries
2 tbsps fresh wild or cultivated blueberries, or frozen wild blueberries, for garnish
Pure maple syrup or raw honey, to taste
Directions:

Place the millet, water, and cinnamon in a small saucepan, stir, and bring it to a boil. Add more water if needed. Reduce to a simmer, cover, and cook until soft, about 10 to 15 minutes, stirring intermittently. Once it’s cooked, remove the saucepan from the heat, cover it, and let it sit for a few minutes. 

Alternatively, place the oats, water, and cinnamon in a small saucepan and bring to a simmer. Add more water if needed. Cover and cook until soft, about 5 to 10 minutes. 

Stir in the wild blueberries and maple syrup to taste. Serve topped with the 2 tablespoons of blueberries.

Get the incredible healing benefits of aloe vera in this sweet grape slushy. Refreshing and delicious, this slushy makes a wonderful light breakfast or snack. If you suffer with constipation, you might find the combination of grapes and aloe vera in this drink brings you welcome relief!

Grapes contain high amounts of powerful antioxidants known as bioflavonoids, resveratrol, and anthocyanins. These phytochemicals are anti-inflammatory, anti-viral, anti-microbial, anti-aging, and anti-cancerous and provide protection against anemia, degenerative nerve diseases, heart disease, viral and fungal infections, Alzheimer’s, and autoimmune disorders. Grapes can also help provide relief from asthma, migraines, constipation, gastritis, chronic acidosis, indigestion, kidney disorders, fatigue, and vision problems.

Fresh aloe leaf gel binds onto toxic debris in the intestinal tract and carries it out of the colon during elimination. Aloe also reduces poisons and toxins in the intestinal tract so that they don’t travel up to the liver. It expels and diminishes ammonia inside the intestinal tract that otherwise seeps into the liver when food is putrefying due to low hydrochloric acid and bile production.

Aloe also works wonders for assimilation, circulation, and elimination. It is known to purify the blood, reduce inflammation, ease arthritis pain, prevent kidney stones, lower high cholesterol, prevent Candida, boost physical endurance, benefit cardiovascular health, and protect the body from oxidative stress. Aloe soothes ulcers, hemorrhoids, gastritis, diverticulitis, colitis, irritable bowel syndrome, and other digestive disorders. Aloe provides recovery from fatigue and aids in muscle function as well as optimal utilization of several vitamins, minerals, and enzymes. Its alkaline nature helps to soothe acidosis and alkalinize the whole body.

Ingredients:

2 potatoes
2 carrots
1 zucchini
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1 teaspoon onion powder
1 teaspoon dried oregano
1 teaspoon paprika

Directions:

Add 3 inches of water to a medium-sized pot, bring it to a boil, and add a steaming basket. Place the potatoes and carrots in the basket, cover, and steam for 15 to 20 minutes, until tender. Remove from heat and cool completely.

Preheat oven to 350°F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.

Grate the zucchini and place it in a muslin cloth or nut milk bag to squeeze out all the water. Make sure that the zucchini is very dry; otherwise it will take the patties longer to crisp up in the oven. Add it to a mixing bowl. Grate the potatoes and carrots and place them in the bowl with the grated zucchini. Add the garlic powder, onion powder, dried oregano, and paprika and mix until combined.
