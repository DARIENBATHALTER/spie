# Video Playback Fix - Summary

## Problem
Videos were failing to play in the Medical Medium Archive Explorer despite proper file mapping and server setup.

## Root Cause
The `checkVideoExists()` method in `js/video-player.js` was using HTTP HEAD requests to verify video file availability before attempting to load them. However, Python's simple HTTP server doesn't handle HEAD requests reliably for large video files, causing the check to fail even when files are accessible via GET requests.

## Solution
**Removed the problematic HEAD request check** and simplified the video loading process to rely on the browser's native video element error handling.

### Changes Made:

1. **Modified `loadVideo()` method** in `VideoPlayer` class:
   - Removed `checkVideoExists()` call
   - Directly attempt video loading when local path is available
   - Enhanced error handling with try/catch for better fallback

2. **Enhanced `loadLocalVideo()` method**:
   - Added 10-second timeout for video loading
   - Improved error event handling
   - Added `loadstart` event listener for better feedback
   - Better cleanup of event listeners

3. **Improved `showYouTubeFallback()` method**:
   - More informative user messaging
   - Better logging for debugging

## Technical Details

### Before:
```javascript
if (localPath && await this.checkVideoExists(localPath)) {
    await this.loadLocalVideo(localPath, videoData);
} else {
    this.showYouTubeFallback(videoData, dataManager);
}
```

### After:
```javascript
if (localPath) {
    try {
        await this.loadLocalVideo(localPath, videoData);
    } catch (error) {
        this.showYouTubeFallback(videoData, dataManager);
    }
} else {
    this.showYouTubeFallback(videoData, dataManager);
}
```

## Verification
- âœ… Video files are properly served by Python HTTP server (`Content-Type: video/mp4`)
- âœ… Video mapping correctly resolves YouTube IDs to local file paths
- âœ… Browser can load videos directly when HEAD check is bypassed
- âœ… Fallback to YouTube links works when local files are unavailable

## Testing
A test page `test-video-loading.html` was created to demonstrate:
1. Direct video element loading (works)
2. HEAD request method (fails as expected)
3. New VideoPlayer class method (works)

## Result
ðŸŽ‰ **Videos now play correctly in the archive explorer!**

The fix maintains all existing functionality while removing the blocking HEAD request check that was preventing video playback.
